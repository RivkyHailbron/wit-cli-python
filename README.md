- `wit log` – View commit history
- `wit status` – Check for uncommitted changes
- `wit checkout <commit_id>` – Revert to previous versions
- Support for nested directory structure (bonus feature)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Click (for CLI)
- OOP design patterns
- File and directory handling
